# Spelling Checker using AVL Trees (C Project)

This project is a **spelling checker** built in **C**, utilizing a **self-balancing AVL tree** to store and manage a dictionary of words. It reads a list of words from a file, stores them efficiently in a balanced binary search tree, and checks if user-inputted words exist in the dictionary.
